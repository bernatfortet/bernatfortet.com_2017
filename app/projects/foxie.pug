        p Foxie is a reading comprehension tutor for young children, ages 8-12. The goal is to combine a chat-and-voice tutor with a traditional ebook experience.
        p The tutor helps children by showing how to go about applying different reading techniques. Then, the tutor guides them through reflections about the story with what they have learned.

        p The client didn't have a technical team yet but needed to design and develop a pilot for their idea.

        p I designed, developed and built the pilot in React.js, and Redux with Firebase as the backend.

        p A key design consideration was the use of a real voice that read the book out loud and mimicked what was said in the chat. That proved to establish a human connection with the child and also produced a certain level of authority in the tutor who could now be trusted.
        p The key innovation was the introduction of a familiar interface (chat) to the reading experience. We capitalized on the authority created through the use of voice to nudge the child to frequently reflect on the book. When we tested, we saw how children had fun reflecting were motivated to write on every single page even though it was not a requirement of the experience.
        p The massive win here (part of my life research) was to find out how to help create intrinsical motivation at scale through technology. In this case, the design led children to self-driven effort and reflection.

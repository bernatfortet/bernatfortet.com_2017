        p Aviate is a smart and contextual launcher for your Android device that simplifies the clutter of your phone's homescreen.
        p I joined a 5 person start-up team as the lead designer. After launching the beta, we got acquired by Yahoo. During 2015 I continued leading the team toward a GA launch.
        p I lead UI, UX, Interaction Design, and Marketing and collaborated with the founders on product design.

        p The main challenge was how to improve and quicken access to all of the content a user needs. But not all users are the same. Having a clever onboarding and increasingly offering new features was key to user reception of the product. A robust design system based on components ensured consistency.
        p At the same time, one of the key propositions of Aviate was to surface content relevant to the user's context. So, how do you design for thousands of different user contexts?
        p We did it by ruthlessly prototyping simulations of different context and making qualitative assumptions. Then we tested it out with the millions of users we had.

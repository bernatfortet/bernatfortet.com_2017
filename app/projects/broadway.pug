        p Broadway is a design language for Yahoo Content Cards. I led the design effort for content cards (mostly shown in search products).
        p At the time, Yahoo was displaying content in a myriad of ways. Di!erent designers were designing the same pieces. It was necessary to bring consistency and communication across teams.
        p I had to bring together Yahoo’s VP of Design direction, Yahoo’s Design System team and the leads of several content verticals into the same page.

        p One of the big challenges of this project was in getting buy in from dozens of lead designers and PMs in Yahoo. I achieved that by bringing clarity to conversations, listening to designers and PMs needs and coming up with a proposal that was limited with space for "exibility.

        p To bring together multiple design teams I had to create a strict design system that was versatile enough for di!erent types of content. This lead to a design style focused on components that prioritized clarity, actions over information and a cohesive hierarchy of text styles, icons, buttons, and media.
